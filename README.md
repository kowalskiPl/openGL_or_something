# openGL_or_something
That's a small project with my openGL experiments.

By experiments I mean a rotating cube with a wooden box texture and a white cube beeing the light source. And as you may think, having a light source implies existance
of working lightning system, and if you thought so you would be right. But it works for one light source so far.
